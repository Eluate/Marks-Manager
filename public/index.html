            <p>The program was created to allow students to manage their assessments productively.
            It provides tools to assess subject performance across different subjects, and generates a calendar that shows
            upcoming and previous assessments. Data is hosted in the cloud, so assessments can be created and viewed from any device connected to the internet.
            The main processes of the manager are registration, signing in, creating an assessment, deleting an assessment, and viewing assessments.
            The manager is targeted towards high school students and university students as it benefits them the most.
            The manager was created using Node JS, Socket IO and MySQL for the server-side, and HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES5 and Bootstrap 3 for the client-side.</p>
